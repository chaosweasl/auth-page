# Next.js Authentication Demo

A modern authentication implementation using Next.js 14, Supabase Auth, and TailwindCSS. This project demonstrates secure user management and protected routes in a React application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Secure Authentication** using Supabase Auth
- **Protected Routes** with Next.js Middleware
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Modern React Patterns** including React Server Components

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Supabase Auth
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI
- React 19

## 🔒 Security Features

- Middleware-based route protection
- Secure session management

## What I learned from this project

- How to handle authentication flows in Next.js 14 using Supabase Auth
- Implementation of protected routes using Next.js middleware
- Managing user sessions and auth state with React hooks
- Type-safe development with TypeScript in a Next.js environment
- Working with environment variables in a secure manner
- Implementing social authentication providers
- Proper error handling in authentication flows
- Building reusable React components with authentication context

## What else I'd like to add

- A way to upload a profile picture to the database.
- Implement responsive design (it's the least I can do even though it's a backend only project)

## Disclaimer

There is a chance that the authentication won't work. This is because I have to revisit supabase and ask them to unpause my database, since it pauses if it's been inactive for a while (since I'm using free-tier lol). Please keep this in mind.
